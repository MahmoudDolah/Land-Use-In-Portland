		What is Sustainable Transportation?
	</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.rita.dot.gov/utc/sites/rita.dot.gov.utc/files/utc_spotlights/pdf/spotlight_1005.pdf"> Sustainable transportation</a> is the subject of transportation that is sustainable in the sense of social, environmental, and the ability to supply the source energy indefinitely.
	</p>
	<p>
		A sustainable transportation system is one that allows the basic access and development needs of society to be met safely and in a consistent manner with human and ecosystem health, is affordable and operates fairly and efficiently, and limits emissions and waste within the planet’s ability to absorb them.

	<h3>
		Portland: History, Geography, and Economy
	</h3>
	<p>
		The city of Portland first became settled in the 1830s via the Oregon Trail. While most of the settlers via the Oregon Trail settled in Oregon City, a new settlement emerged a little further down towards the Willamette River. At the time, this town was referred to as “Stumptown” because of how many trees were cut down here to allow for its growth.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1845, the two owners of Stumptown, Francis W. Pettygrove and Asa Lovejoy wanted to rename Stumptown after their own respective hometowns (Lovejoy was from Boston and Pettygrove was from Portland, Maine). The gentlemen decided to settle this controversy with a coin toss and Pettygrove won.
	</p>
	<p>
		Afterwards, the population of Portland increased because of people coming in after the California Gold Rush and the large number of sailors from the nearby ports. Between the 1940s and 50s, the city became well known for being a haven for organized crime (so famous, in fact, that a film titled Portland Expose (1957) was made based on it). During the 1960s, Portland experienced an influx of the hippie subculture that has taken root in the city’s identity. This has lead to the unofficial city slogan “Keep Portland Weird.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, Portland has a population of 632,209 people and nearly 2.4 million people in it’s Metropolitan Statistical Area.
	</p>
	<p>
		According to the US census Bureau, the city has a total area of 145.09 square miles and Portland is located sixty miles to the east of the Pacific Ocean at the northern end of Oregon’s most populace region, the Willamette Valley. Most of downtown Portland is relatively flat, however, the northwest and southwest parts of the city are at the foothills of the Tualatin Mountains, also known as the “West Hills.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Interestingly, Portland lies on top of an extinct volcanic field known as the Boring Lava Field and it lies in the center of southeast Portland. Mount St. Helens, which is a highly active volcano, is located 50 miles northeast of the city in Washington State and is easily visible on clear days.
	</p>
	<p>
		The economy of Portland has been fairly strong throughout its history. At first, it was largely lumber industry, however, just before World War II, the steel industry became the number one employer in the metropolitan area.
	</p>
	<p>
		In more modern times, Portland has experienced a tech boom. Companies such as Intel, Airbnb, Nvidia, and Oracle all have main offices located there. A result of this has been a large population boom of 90,000 people between 2000 and 2014. This has lead to Portland being nicknamed the “Silicon Forest.”

		Transportation and Urbanization History
	</h2>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EjI9JQ_KFqY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p>
		Portland has a very extensive transportation system. As of 2006, nearly 13% of people commute by public transportation every day, which puts them at one of the highest in the United States.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most commonly used form of public transportation is the bus. Portland’s bus system has 610 buses along 80 bus routes that span all throughout the city. The main reason that the bus is so widely used is because of the frequent service routes. Frequent service routes are routes that guarantee a 15 minute wait or less. This service is offered on the twelve most commonly used lines.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another popular mode of transportation is the MAX Light Rail, which spans all throughout the city. Portland’s light rail system consists of five color-coded lines - Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, and Orange. The MAX Light Rail has 97 stations and the average weekday ridership is nearly 130,000.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Portland streetcar is a two-line streetcar system that serves the downtown area of Portland. The system first opened in 2001 and now, after a few extensions, has a nearly 4 mile long route and serves 20,000 riders a day.

	<h3>
		What is Urban Sprawl?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Urban sprawl is the expansion of people away from central urban areas and into low density suburbs. Some characteristics of urban sprawl are that urban developments that exhibit low density and scattered development. Due to the low density and scattered nature of suburbs, it causes an increased reliance on cars to get around.
	</p>
	<p>
		This leads to an inefficient use of land and causes inner cities to suffer. However, the local governments of Portland have created a solution – the urban growth boundary.
	</p>
	<p>
		More specifically, <a href="http://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/urban-growth-review-qa-regions-urban-growth-boundary"> during the 1970s</a>, sprawl was dominating urban development in the West Coast. Cities, such as Los Angeles, San Jose, and Phoenix developed large subdivisions and freeways to connect them together.
	</p>
	<h3>
		What is an Urban Growth Boundary and why use it?
	</h3>
	<img class="displayed" src="http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/summer08articles/summer08gifs/p39p2-lg.jpg" alt="http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/summer08articles/summer08gifs/p39p2-lg.jpg">
	<p>
		Portland’s land usage is one of the most efficient and comprehensive in the USA because of their adoption of the <a href="http://www.oregonmetro.gov/urban-growth-boundary">Urban Growth boundary</a>. The urban growth boundary reduced the need and desire for people to drive because it establishes urban growth zones that mandate that an area be used for high density housing. Unlike many other cities in the United States that suffer from urban sprawl, Portland has kept its city alive.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, in order to deal with the rising cost of housing, Portland has had to increase the size of the zone several times since its inception. Also, it has caused an increase in the price of farmland in a few of the rural zones.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still, it is clear that the usage of the urban growth boundary has allowed Portland to be the most environmentally friendly city in the United States. The fact that certain areas are forced to be used for high density housing has allowed the TriMet (Portland’s version of the MTA) to effectively and efficiently plan its light rail and bus routes in order to make transportation the most efficient way to travel around, which is good for the environment.

	<h2>
		Lessons Learned
	</h2>
	<p>
		Despite the potential downfalls, the Portland's use of the urban growth boundary can be declared a success. The following image is a map of the population density of Portland.
	</p>
	<img class="displayed" src="http://pics3.city-data.com/assessments/cities/Portland-Oregon.1.png" alt="Portland Population Density Map" style="width:363px;height363px">
	<p>
		Notice how the inner city is more red (which here indicates a higher population density, while blue indicates a lower population density).
	</p>
	<h3>
		Challenges
	</h3>
	<p>
		The biggest challenge to introducing an urban growth boundary is setting the line properly. For instance, if the line is not set properly, then it will too heavily restrict the amount of land that can be used. For instance, the land use policies in Portland have been criticized as artificially increasing farm prices by reducing the land that can be used. 
	
	</p>
	<h3>
		Other Cities
	</h3>
	<p>
		Other cities over the world, and in the United States, have implemented similar land use policies. The United Kingdom has made attempts to control the urban development of London since the 16th century. The system they use is called the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6947435.stm"> Green Belt.</a> The system first came into fruition in 1947 and has been met with a lot of criticism for being too harsh. For example, the housing space is believed to be <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/03/house-prices-and-pension-pots"> too small.</a> 
	</p>
	<p>
		Another instance of it's use would be in Boulder, Colorado; Honolulu, Hawaii; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky; and Seattle, Washington. In the United States, urban growth boundaries have, generally, been more successful at reducing sprawl. This is due, in part, with the fact that sprawl is considered to be much more of a problem in the United States than it is in Europe. Also of note, is that in the United Kingdom and other areas in Europe and Asia, urban growth boundaries are implemented to maintain areas for farmland, while cities in the United States implement them to maintain cities. 
	</p>
	<h3> 
		Application to New York City
	</h3>
	<p>
		While the urban growth boundary has been very successful in other parts of the world, it does not have much use in New York City. First, the main usage of the urban growth boundary in the United States is to preserve inner cities. However, nearly all of NYC is high density and does not need it to be preserved, with the possible exception of Staten Island (as shown in the image below). Secondly, the other reason for having an urban growth boundary is to preserve farmland, however, New York City has no farmland that needs to be preserved. Finally, an urban growth boundary would be a nightmare to set up because of New Jersey. New York City directly borders New Jersey and many residents of New Jersey commute to work (so much so that parts of New Jersey are considered to be apart of the New York Metro Area). Getting legislation to set up one urban growth boundary for both cities would be a bureacratic nightmare. 
	</p>
	<img class="displayed" src="http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/city-vs-city/61348d1271341386-there-best-way-determine-comparative-city-nyc.jpg" alt="Population density in NYC" style="height:800px;width:800px">
	<p>
		However, this does not mean that New York City has nothing to learn from the city of Portland. While New York City has always been very walkable, the borough of Staten Island could improve it's pedestrian infrastructure. While still more dense than most places in the United States, Staten Island suffers from a lot of the same land use and transportation problems that many other cities in the US have.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, Staten Island needs to improve its public transportation system. While it has a decent bus system, this borough, more than any other, has an over reliance on transportation via motor vehicles. Second, walking in Staten Island is nearly impossible. Finally, the public spaces in Staten Island are not created with mixed uses in mind. Anecdotally, a common hangout spot for my family in Staten Island is a parking lot that is a five minute walk from their house, however, this parking lot does not have any type of bench or other seating area. This makes it very difficult to hang out in a public setting. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Conclusions
	</h2>
	<p>
		To conclude, in Portland, the urban growth boundary has been very successful in keeping the center of the city alive. While many other cities in the United States have fallen victim to urban sprawl, Portland has been able to stave it off and it remains a cultural hot bed and very welcoming place to live.  
	</p>
	<p>
		In order for Portland to continue its success, it should maintain the current system that it has. However, I also believe that it should improve the bus lines (by means of increasing the number of frequent service routes) or include more stops on the light rail system. Fortunately, there are not many neighborhoods in Portland that are cut off from public transportation (unlike in New York City), so this is not a huge problem. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For many cities in the United States, instituting an urban growth boundary would be very beneficial for maintaining a sustainable transportation system. An urban growth boundary, combined with a robust public transportation system and mixed land use, are the corner stones of creating a successful city.
