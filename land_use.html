        What is Sustainable Transportation?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Sustainable transportation is the subject of transportation that is sustainable in the sense of social, environmental, and the ability to supply the source energy indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sustainable transportation system is one that allows the basic access and development needs of society to be met safely and in a consistent manner with human and ecosystem health, is affordable and operates fairly and efficiently, and limits emissions
        and waste within the planet’s ability to absorb them.

        Portland: History, Geography, and Economy
    </h3>
    <p>
        The city of Portland first became settled in the 1830s via the Oregon Trail. While most of the settlers via the Oregon Trail settled in Oregon City, a new settlement emerged a little further down towards the Willamette River. At the time, this town was
        referred to as “Stumptown” because of how many trees were cut down here to allow for its growth.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1845, the two owners of Stumptown, Francis W. Pettygrove and Asa Lovejoy wanted to rename Stumptown after their own respective hometowns (Lovejoy was from Boston and Pettygrove was from Portland, Maine). The gentlemen decided to settle this controversy
        with a coin toss and Pettygrove won.
    </p>
    <p>
        Afterwards, the population of Portland increased because of people coming in after the California Gold Rush and the large number of sailors from the nearby ports. Between the 1940s and 50s, the city became well known for being a haven for organized crime
        (so famous, in fact, that a film titled Portland Expose (1957) was made based on it). During the 1960s, Portland experienced an influx of the hippie subculture that has taken root in the city’s identity. This has lead to the unofficial city slogan
        “Keep Portland Weird.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, Portland has a population of 632,209 people and nearly 2.4 million people in it’s Metropolitan Statistical Area.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the US census Bureau, the city has a total area of 145.09 square miles and Portland is located sixty miles to the east of the Pacific Ocean at the northern end of Oregon’s most populace region, the Willamette Valley. Most of downtown Portland
        is relatively flat, however, the northwest and southwest parts of the city are at the foothills of the Tualatin Mountains, also known as the “West Hills.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Interestingly, Portland lies on top of an extinct volcanic field known as the Boring Lava Field and it lies in the center of southeast Portland. Mount St. Helens, which is a highly active volcano, is located 50 miles northeast of the city in Washington
        State and is easily visible on clear days.
    </p>
    <p>
        The economy of Portland has been fairly strong throughout its history. At first, it was largely lumber industry, however, just before World War II, the steel industry became the number one employer in the metropolitan area.
    </p>
    <p>
        In more modern times, Portland has experienced a tech boom. Companies such as Intel, Airbnb, Nvidia, and Oracle all have main offices located there. A result of this has been a large population boom of 90,000 people between 2000 and 2014. This has lead
        to Portland being nicknamed the “Silicon Forest.”

        Portland has a very extensive transportation system. As of 2006, nearly 13% of people commute by public transportation every day, which puts them at one of the highest in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most commonly used form of public transportation is the bus. Portland’s bus system has 610 buses along 80 bus routes that span all throughout the city. The main reason that the bus is so widely used is because of the frequent service routes. Frequent
        service routes are routes that guarantee a 15 minute wait or less. This service is offered on the twelve most commonly used lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another popular mode of transportation is the MAX Light Rail, which spans all throughout the city. Portland’s light rail system consists of five color-coded lines - Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, and Orange. The MAX Light Rail has 97 stations and the average
        weekday ridership is nearly 130,000.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Portland streetcar is a two-line streetcar system that serves the downtown area of Portland. The system first opened in 2001 and now, after a few extensions, has a nearly 4 mile long route and serves 20,000 riders a day.
